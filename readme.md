**Gecho - A template to rapidly spin up a Go web app.**
Gecho is a template to quickly spin up a Go web application using the Echo framework, go HTML templates, and a SQLite database.
Out of the box it includes a quick Todo List as a starting point to show how things are done, but should be quick to remove the example code and use this for your own project.

This does not include best practices, and my Go code is probably a little messy, but this workflow made sense to me.
